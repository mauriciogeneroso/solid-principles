# What is SOLID?

SOLID is an acronym for 5 important design principles when doing OOP (Object Oriented Programming). The SOLID principles were first introduced by the famous Computer Scientist Robert J. Martin (or Uncle Bob) in his paper in 2000. But the SOLID acronym was introduced later by Michael Feathers.

SOLID are five patterns to encourage us to create more maintainable, understandable, and flexible software. Consequently, as our applications grow in size, we can reduce their complexity.

Each letter from SOLID have a meaning:

<strong>S</strong> - Single-responsiblity Principle </br>
<strong>O</strong> - Open-closed Principle </br>
<strong>L</strong> - Liskov Substitution Principle </br>
<strong>I</strong> - Interface Segregation Principle </br>
<strong>D</strong> - Dependency Inversion Principle </br>

## SRP => Single-responsiblity Principle

This principle means:
```
A class should have one and only one reason to change, meaning that a class should have only one job.
```

How does this principle help us to build better software? Let's see a few of its benefits:

* <strong>Testing</strong> – A class with one responsibility will have far fewer test cases.
* <strong>Lower coupling</strong> – Less functionality in a single class will have fewer dependencies.
* <strong>Organization</strong> – Smaller, well-organized classes are easier to search than monolithic ones.
